## MediaWiki
[MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) is a free and open-source wiki software package written in PHP. It
serves as the platform for Wikipedia and the other Wikimedia projects, used
by hundreds of millions of people each month. MediaWiki is localised in over
350 languages and its reliability and robust feature set have earned it a large
and vibrant community of third-party users and developers.

MediaWiki is:

* feature-rich and extensible, both on-wiki and with hundreds of extensions;
* scalable and suitable for both small and large sites;
* simple to install, working on most hardware/software combinations; and
* available in your language.

## Licensing information
Extensions and skins may be released under different licenses than MediaWiki itself.
